# Set Up a React Project

Setting up a React project has been made really simple with the `Create React App` executable command.
To set up a React project, run the following command in your terminal `npx create-react-app <name-of-your-react-project>`.

For example:
`npx create-react-app todo-app`

**Note:** For npx to run the command, you need to make sure you have `Nodejs` installed on your system.
